# ── Worker pools ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# EARLY ALPHA, SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. This tracks two upstream
# features that are themselves alpha: n8n's own worker pools, and the chart
# support for them (queueMode.workerGroups, n8n-io/n8n-hosting#189), merged to
# the chart's preview/worker-pools branch but not released to a numbered chart
# version. This file's shape, defaults and guards may change to match either
# upstream, without the usual deprecation path.
#
# Maps var.n8n_worker_pools onto the chart's queueMode.workerGroups, which
# renders one worker Deployment per pool plus a KEDA ScaledObject watching that
# pool's own `jobs-<name>` queue.
#
# The module keeps its own input shape rather than passing the chart's through
# verbatim: pool names are validated at plan time (see variables.tf), the
# per-pool sizing knobs fall back to the module-wide worker defaults instead of
# the chart's, and a pool here is always a pool, whereas a chart worker group
# without a poolName is just an extra unlabelled worker deployment.
#
# Requires a chart version whose queueMode.workerGroups exists. n8n-hosting's
# own release-please cuts numbered releases from main independently of the
# preview/worker-pools branch that carries the feature, so no numbered
# version can be trusted as a floor: one that predates the feature ships
# under the same versioning scheme as one that would carry it, and a
# release cut from main can never prove the feature is present.
# Until n8n-io/n8n-hosting#189 merges to main and a numbered release
# actually carries it, only a prerelease build passes automatically, or a
# numbered build the caller attests with n8n_worker_pools_chart_verified
# (see that variable and locals.n8n_chart_renders_worker_pools below).
# n8n-io/n8n-hosting#191 registered a `Preview chart` GitHub Action on that
# repo's main branch that packages preview/worker-pools and publishes an
# official prerelease build to oci://ghcr.io/n8n-io/n8n-helm-chart (this
# module's default n8n_chart_repository) once someone with write access to
# that repo dispatches it against preview/worker-pools. See n8n_chart_version
# and the two checks at the bottom of this file, and
# examples/worker-pools/README.md for the exact command and a
# private-mirror fallback.

locals {
  # First n8n release that reads N8N_WORKER_POOLS_ENABLED and
  # N8N_WORKER_POOL_NAME (packages/@n8n/config, scaling-mode.config.ts, first
  # tagged in n8n@2.39.0). Older images accept both variables and ignore them:
  # mains never route to a pool and pool workers consume the default queue.

  # No numbered n8n-hosting release carries queueMode.workerGroups: the
  # feature is merged only to the preview/worker-pools branch, and main's own
  # release-please cuts ship independently of it. There is no real floor to
  # compare against yet, so a numbered version only passes if the caller
  # explicitly attests it with n8n_worker_pools_chart_verified -- for example
  # a private mirror serving a numbered build of the feature branch. A
  # prerelease passes automatically, taken at the caller's word via the
  # SemVer 2 "-prerelease" separator specifically, with no extra input
  # needed. n8n_chart_version's own validation also allows an optional
  # "+buildmetadata" suffix with no hyphen (e.g. "1.11.0+build.5"); Helm
  # ignores build metadata when resolving a chart from an HTTPS repository,
  # so that string can resolve to plain "1.11.0" -- the exact silent
  # no-render case this guard exists to stop. Checking for the hyphen
  # directly, rather than "fails a strict X.Y.Z match", is what keeps a
  # build-metadata-only version from falling through as if it were a
  # prerelease. Replace this whole local with a real floor and a numeric
  # compare once n8n-io/n8n-hosting#189 merges to main and a numbered
  # release carries the feature; n8n_worker_pools_chart_verified can retire
  # at the same time.

  # pool's ScaledObject is templated entirely by the chart from the pool name,
  # and triggerMetadata is the only way to reach it. That rules out this
  # module's usual TriggerAuthentication + authenticationRef pattern for pools
  # specifically: the chart gives a pool group no authenticationRef field to
  # point at one. Empty on a deployment without TLS or authentication, and the
  # chart guards the block with `with`, so it renders nothing on that path.

# ── Guards ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Both of these exist because the failure they catch is silent in every other
# place it could be caught. A chart that predates queueMode.workerGroups has no
# additionalProperties: false on queueMode, so Helm accepts the key, renders
# nothing for it, and the release succeeds: N8N_WORKER_POOLS_ENABLED lands on
# every pod, no pool Deployment or ScaledObject exists, and every project
# pinned to a pool quietly runs on the default queue. Mocked plan-time tests
# cannot see any of that, and neither can a real plan; only counting the
# rendered Deployments after apply can (tests/scripts/verify-worker-pools.sh).
#
# The chart pairing is a hard stop, enforced as a precondition on
# helm_release.n8n (n8n.tf) because it is a property of that resource and
# because letting the apply proceed past a warning is exactly the silent
# outcome described above. A prerelease version is exempt automatically,
# which is how the official preview build (see the top of this file and
# examples/worker-pools/README.md) is installed while no release carries
# the feature; a numbered version passes only if the caller sets
# n8n_worker_pools_chart_verified, for a private mirror serving a numbered
# build it has already verified. The image pairing stays a warning, not a hard
# stop: n8n_image_tag is usually null (the chart's floating `stable`), which
# the check cannot see, so it cannot be relied on to catch every case. Unlike
# the chart pairing, an old image does not fail loudly -- it silently accepts
# and ignores N8N_WORKER_POOLS_ENABLED and N8N_WORKER_POOL_NAME, so the pods
# come up healthy with the feature doing nothing (measured; this is what the
# check's own error_message below describes, and what
# tests/scripts/verify-worker-pools.sh exists to catch after apply). A
# missing feat:workerPools licence entitlement is the one pool-related
# failure that *is* loud (the pooled workers exit 1), but that is a separate
# concern from the image tag and Terraform cannot see it at plan either.
